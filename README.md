This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running the App

Install dependencies and run the app:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
A browser window will automatically be opened to localhost:3000 where the app will be running.

If the window does not open automatically for some reason, simply open a browser and navigate to localhost:3000
